title: "oneAPI"

Support for the oneAPI programming model is a work in progress, and can be found
in the unregistered [oneAPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl) package.
The package aims to offer the same level of programmability as the Julia CUDA
stack, i.e., both offering an array-based and kernel programming model.
