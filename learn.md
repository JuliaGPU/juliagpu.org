# Learn

Currently, the Julia CUDA stack is the most mature, easiest to install, and
full-featured.
The [CUDA.jl](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/) repository is
a central place for the documentation of all relevant packages.
Start with the instructions on [how to install](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/installation/overview/) the stack, and follow with this [introductory tutorial](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/tutorials/introduction/).

If you prefer videos, the presentations below highlight different aspects
of the toolchain.

## Effective CUDA GPU computing in Julia

* Design and benefits of the Julia GPU stack
* Composability with existing (non-GPU) software
* Performance killers and tools for optimization
* Demonstration
