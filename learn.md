# Learn

Currently, the Julia CUDA stack is the most mature, easiest to install, and
full-featured. The [CUDA.jl documentation](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/) is
a central place for information on all relevant packages. Start with the
instructions on [how to
install](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/installation/overview/) the stack, and
follow with this [introductory
tutorial](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/tutorials/introduction/). There are
also a series of [notebooks on more advanced uses of
CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/Learning/tree/main/Courses/AdvancedCUDA),
including application and kernel optimization, as well as advanced memory
management and concurrent programming concepts (which apply to other back-ends
as well).

If you prefer video material, there are plenty of talks and workshops on GPU
programming in Julia to be found on Youtube. For example:


## GPU programming in Julia

3-hour workshop covering various of the toolchain:

* Array programming
* Kernel programminng
* Parallel proggramming concepts
* CUDA.jl application and kernel profiling
* Image processing using AMDGPU.jl
* Vendor-neutral GPU programming with KernelAbstractions.jl

## Concurrent GPU computing in CUDA.jl 3.0

Introduction to concurrent GPU computing:

* Overlapping GPU computations
* Using multiple devices
* Using threads
