The only important change is that the minimal required Julia version has been
bumped to 1.10, in anticipation of it becoming the next LTS release.


## New features

- Support for the upcoming Julia 1.11 release has been added, as well as for
  [CUDA 12.6 (Update 1)](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/2461).
- Launch overhead has been reduced by [avoiding double argument
  conversions](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/2472). Note that this
  does not apply to kernels that are obtained using `@cuda launch=false`.
- CUSOLVER's dense wrappers have been improved by [Ben
  Arthur](https://github.com/bjarthur), [now caching workspace
  buffers](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/2465). This should greatly
  reduce the number of allocations needed for repeated calls.
- [Alexis Montoison](https://github.com/amontoison) has improved the CUSPARSE
  wrappers, adding [conversions between sparse vectors and sparse
  matrices](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/2489) that enable [a
  version of `gemv`](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/2488) which
  preserves sparsity of the inputs.
- CUDA.jl's CUFFT wrappers [now support
  `Float16`](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/2430), thanks to [Erik
  Schnetter](https://github.com/eschnett).
