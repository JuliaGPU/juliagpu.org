## oneMKL integration

oneAPI.jl now uses the Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL), automatically
downloaded via `oneAPI_Support_jll.jl`, to provide a great number of BLAS and
LAPACK operations on Intel GPUs. Similar to how it is implemented in our other
GPU back-ends, these wrappers are available at different levels.

At the lowest level, we provide a C library that provides BLAS and LAPACK-like
functions that the oneMKL C++ APIs. For example, the
`oneapi::mkl::blas::column_major::gemm` function for matrix-matrix
multiplication is wrapped by the C functions `onemklSgemm`, `onemklDgemm`, etc.
These wrappers are used to implement low-level methods like `oneMKL.gemm!`:

```julia-repl
julia> using oneAPI

julia> A = oneArray(rand(Float32, 2, 3));
2×3 oneMatrix{Float32, oneAPI.oneL0.DeviceBuffer}:
 0.44302   0.125576  0.859145
 0.674291  0.428346  0.0400119
julia> B = oneArray(rand(Float32, 3, 4))
3×4 oneMatrix{Float32, oneAPI.oneL0.DeviceBuffer}:
 0.592748   0.529413   0.0323396  0.659528
 0.22489    0.0872259  0.253291   0.376519
 0.0121506  0.591135   0.706755   0.751686
julia> C = similar(B, (2, 4));

julia> oneMKL.gemm!('N', 'N', true, A, B, true, C)
2×4 oneMatrix{Float32, oneAPI.oneL0.DeviceBuffer}:
 0.301279  0.753365  0.65334   0.985274
 0.496501  0.417994  0.158581  0.63607

julia> Array(C) ≈ Array(A) * Array(B)
true
```

Of course, these low-level functions aren't very user-friendly, so we also
integrate with Julia's standard libraries where possible:

```julia-repl
julia> A = oneArray(rand(Float32, 2, 3));
julia> B = oneArray(rand(Float32, 3, 4));

julia> using LinearAlgebra
julia> C = A * B;

julia> Array(C) ≈ Array(A) * Array(B)
true
```

The most frequently used oneMKL BLAS functions have been wrapped and integrated
with Julia’s standard linear algebra libraries. If you run into a missing
function, please file a request to add it, or take a look at the source and
contribute to oneAPI.jl! The current state of the wrappers should make it easy
to extend their functionality, as well as form a good basis for integrating with
other libraries like oneDNN.


## Intel Arc support

The new Arc series of discrete Intel GPUs are now fully supported by oneAPI.jl. These GPUs
offer a significant performance improvement over their typically integrated predecessors:

```julia-repl
julia> using oneAPI
julia> oneAPI.versioninfo()
1 device:
- Intel(R) Arc(TM) A770 Graphics [0x56a0]

julia> T = Float32;
julia> n = p = m = 2048;
julia> a = oneArray(rand(T, n, p));
julia> b = oneArray(rand(T, p, m));
julia> c = oneArray(zeros(T, n, m));

julia> using BenchmarkTools, LinearAlgebra
julia> bench = @benchmark oneAPI.@sync mul!(c, a, b)
BenchmarkTools.Trial: 1510 samples with 1 evaluation.

```

For example, here we're getting 5 TFlops of Float32 performance, which is over 10x faster
than the Intel Xe Graphics G7 we had been previously using for oneAPI.jl development. At the
same time, the A770 used above should be able to deliver close to 20 TFlops, so there's
still room for improvement.

To use oneAPI.jl with an Arc series GPU, you need to use Linux 6.2. At the time of writing,
that version is still in beta, so refer to your distribution's documentation for how to
install it. For example, on Arch Linux you can use the [`linux-mainline` package from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-mainline), Ubuntu has the [`kernel-ppa`
archive](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds), Fedora provides the [`stable-rc`
repository](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Kernel_Vanilla_Repositories), etc.
