# JuliaGPU website

This repository hosts the landing page of the JuliaGPU organization. It is intended to
quickly describe the GPU programming capabilities of the Julia programming language, and
point to relevant resources for each of the GPU platforms.

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the master branch is automatically
deployed by Travis.
